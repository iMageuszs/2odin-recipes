<h2>Tim's Kotlety and Rice recipe</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Why cook this?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>It's cheap, ridiculously easy to cook and surprisingly good.</p>
        <p>Can be stored in a ready to cook state in a fridge for some time, like a week and a half or so.</p>
        <p>Will also include a russian salad recipe.</p></dd>

    <dt><b>What tools you will need</b></dt>
        <dd><p>A pot for the rice and a skillet with a lid for kotlety, a container to store leftover kotlety meat.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>Ingredients</b></dt>
        <dd><p>Technically you can choose what ever ground meat you like, but i prefer my kotlety from beef.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>Beef will store better than chicken or pork, so if you are considering having kotlety today and in a week, then choose beef.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>I am not taking lamb or horse meat, because it's a budget build...i mean budget food.</p></dd>
            <ul><b>The list:</b>
                <li>500gr ground meat</li>
                <li>300gr onions </li>
                <li>rice</li>
                <li>1pc tomatoes</li>
                <li>2pc cucumbers</li>
                <li>50g sour cream</li>
                <li>sunflower oil</li>
                <li>spices like corriander, nutmeg, or whatever you have</li>
                <li>salt and pepper TT</li>
            </ul>
       
    <dt><b><p>Let's get cooking!</p></b></dt>
    <dd><p>Personally i prefer my kotlety with roughly chooped onions and without eggs or other binding agents,</dd></p>
        <p>But if you want to impress yourself, then you can add 1 egg for every 500gr of meat.</p>
        <ol><p><b>Mise en Place:</b></p>
          <li>chop onions</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><p><b>Preparation process:</b></p>
          <li>put meat, chopped onions, spices, oil, salt and pepper into a bowl</li>
          <li>mix with hands while smashing onions to release juice</li>
          <li>start the rice, considering int takes 15 minutes to fry kotlety</li>
          <li>and preheat your skillet and add some oil</li>
          <li>shape your kotlety, 100-150 gr each</li>
          <li>on a hot skillet sear kotlety to promote more taste</li>
          <li>then cover skillet with lid and reduce heat to low and let stew for 7-10 mins</li>
          <li>meanwile cut tomatoes and cucumbers, add sour cream</li>
          <li>now rice should be ready, put some on your plate, put kotlety and pour the liquid from the skillet over the rice</li>
        </ol>
</dd>
    <dt><b>With what it is enjoyed well</b></dt>
      <dd><p>A shot of russian vodka right before having a bite of kotlety and covering it up with a bit of salad.</p></dd>
