<h2>Tim's Lazy Chili Recipe (vegeterian)</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Why cook this?</b></dt>
        <dd><p>It's delicious. Easy to cook, as in takes minimal culinary skills into play.</p>
        <p>Cheap! Can be stored in a fridge for a week. And on day 3-4 it tastes the best!</p>
        <p>Best consumed with rice, due to beans lacking all 9 essential amino acids.</p></dd>

    <dt><b>What tools you will need</b></dt>
        <dd><p>A pot or a skillet with high walls for Chili and another for rice, chopping board, something to stir with</p> 
            <p>and something to put food on a plate from the pot. A plate, but not neccessary ;) And a kettle.</p></dd>
    <dt><b>Ingredients</b></dt>
        <dd><p>First, need to select the beans: white - better for beginners, red/black - not for amateurs.</p></dd>
        <dd><p>Beans need to be soaked for some time (4-12 hours), so plan ahead!</p></dd>
        <dd><p>As for other ingredients, they depend on the region you live in, so buy what is freshest.</p></dd>
            <ul><b>The list:</b>
                <li>onions (preferably white)</li>
                <li>carrots</li>
                <li>tomatoes (red)</li>
                <li>bell peppers (red)</li>
                <li>chili flakes or fresh chilis (depends on your heat tolerance)</li>
                <li>spices (corriander, basil, thyme, black pepper)</li>
                <li>lime or lemon</li>
                <li>oil with high smoking point</li>
                <li>salt TT</li>
            </ul>
       
    <dt><b><p>Let's get cooking!</p></b></dt>
    <dd><p><i>Before you start:</i> beans to an inexperienced "user" are to be taken with caution, cuz of the GAS...</dd></p>
        <p>If that's the case, then get rid of the water they were soaked in, bring them to boil and drain once more.</p>
        <ol><p><b>Mise en Place:</b></p>
          <li>1-2 hours | cook the beans until 8/10 ready</li>
          <li>roughly cut carrots, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes</li>
          <li>prepare hot water in kettle</li>
        </ol>
        <ol><p><b>Preparation process:</b></p>
          <li>stirfry carrots and onions until golden</li>
          <li>start the rice, assumin it takes 15-20 minutes</li>
          <li>add bell peppers, tomatoes and spices, high heat 5-10 mins</li>
          <li>add beans and fry a bit more to add more taste</li>
          <li>pour boiling water to just cover the beans</li>
          <li>let simmer on low heat and closed lid for 20-30 minutes or until the beans are ready</li>
         </ol>
